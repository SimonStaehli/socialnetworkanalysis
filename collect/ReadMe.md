## Data Collection

Our data collection took place over the Twitter-API, where we applied for API-keys. With these keys we have limited access to all API-functions provided by twitter.
We are using *tweepy* to scrape all the tweets from the API. Specifically we used the files *executable.py* to collect automatically a certain number of tweets and their retweets from
the API.
