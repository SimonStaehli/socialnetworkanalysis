## Data Collection

Our data collection took place over the Twitter-API, where we applied for API-keys. With these keys we have limited access to all API-functions provided by twitter.
We are using *tweepy* to scrape all the tweets from the API. Specifically we used the files *executable.py* to collect automatically a certain number of tweets and their retweets from
the API. 

Each group member used a different form of the *executable.py* adapted to different search_keys with different hashtags. Therefore the *executable.py* can be called within the interpreter and it should run automatically and download all tweets, save it to the data folder concatenate to one file and store the older files in the an archived folder.
